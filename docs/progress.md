# Progress

Newest on top.

## 2026-11-13 (task plan)
- Done: TASKS.md (16 sequential tasks) merged; T01 done (SPEC.md brought up to date); phase gates removed.
- Found: nothing new.
- Next: T03 (September plant snapshot and register-lag table), then T02, T04, T05.

## 2026-11-13 (walking skeleton)
- Done: baseline 1 (rank by roof electricity yield) through all five stages; helpers `first_pv_date`, `build_pool`, `make_label`; tests on the helpers and on the committed data; CI runs notebooks 02 to 05 and diffs `figures/metrics.csv`.
- Found: roof file columns are upper case (`GWR_EGID`, `KLASSE`, `FLAECHE`, `STROMERTRAG`); 12.5% of the 76,171 residential buildings have no roof record. Roof yield does not beat random on the test (ROC AUC 0.48, capture at 5% of 3.6%): adoption peaks in the middle of the yield range and falls for the largest roofs.
- Found (filters, train cut-off): of 67,482 at-risk buildings, 4,049 new builds are dropped (21.7% adopt), 5,567 without a roof record (5.0% adopt) and 1,294 with a small roof (4.4% adopt); the 56,572 kept adopt at 8.6%.
- Open: stage 01 needs Python 3.11 or later (`datetime.UTC`); check against Nuvolos.
- Next: baseline 2 (neighbour PV share), then tariffs and LASSO.

## 2026-11-13
- Done: spec interview and SPEC.md; data sources checked (the plant register has EGID); repo setup files.
- Found: register lag in 2025; heating-date leakage; tariffs nearly constant. See docs/decisions.md.
- Next: walking skeleton (baseline 1, roof yield, through all five stages). Open items: add docs/proposal.md, confirm `.claude/` with the TA, check the Nuvolos Python version, open the 1.5 GB roof file.
